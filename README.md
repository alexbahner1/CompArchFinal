# CompArchFinal Project

An exploration of processor design and instruction set architecture for Olin College Computer Architecture Fall 2019

### Documentation
Our [website](https://sites.google.com/view/calculatorprocessor/home) includes implementation details and documentation for the research we did over the course of this project.

##### To run processor and see it compute an operation, run the following command:
```
$ iverilog -o calc calculator.t.v
$ ./calc
```
